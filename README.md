# Groq Function Chat - Arithmetic Operations

This Python application demonstrates how to integrate Groq's API to handle function calls for performing basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can interact with the application through a console-based chat interface, where their queries are processed using Groq's API.
